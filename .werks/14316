A ServiceAccount is required to access the cluster collector API externally,
i.e. from the Checkmk monitoring server. Our helm chart now has an additional
option, 'serviceAccount', which allows you to configure the name of this
ServiceAccount and whether it should be created. This can be useful when
set-ups are managed automatically via scripts (Ansible, Terraform, ...).
