Previously, the installation notes assumed that the secrets created via the helm command always have
tokens associated with them. This is no longer the case, since ServiceAccount tokens are no longer
generated automatically from Kubernetes version 1.24.0. With this werk, The installation notes
detail the required steps to obtain the token.
